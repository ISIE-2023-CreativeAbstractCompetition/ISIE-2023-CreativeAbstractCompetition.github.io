00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:21,320
Have you ever dreamt about the future of sustainable cement production?

2
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:35,240
And it occupies your mind, whatever you do.

3
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,720
Not giving you a rest, even if you just want to relax.

4
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,240
So I did, what everybody would have done in my place.

5
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:53,240
Call my favourite fortune teller.

6
00:00:53,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Hello, I'm sorry, but do you know how we can reach Paris Agreement compatible cement production?

7
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Don't worry dear, you talk to a true fortune teller.

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:12,240
Nothing can hide from my third eye.

9
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,240
It's cement, we're talking about.

10
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Yes, thank you.

11
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,240
Cement is currently responsible for 8% of the global greenhouse gas emissions.

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:29,240
So it's really important to better understand how to decarbonise it.

13
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,240
What a concrete problem!

14
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,240
I'm connecting with the universe right now.

15
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,240
But wait, there's an obscure fog clouding my vision...

16
00:01:45,273 --> 00:01:54,240
It seems that cement is not only hard to abate, but also hard to predict

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,240
Hmm, before, she never failed me.

18
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:04,240
You know, if you try attending the ISIE conference,

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:11,240
there's a poster by Amelie Müller and colleagues on prospective life cycle assessment of the global cement production.

20
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:16,240
They coupled the output of intergrated assessment models with prospective LCA

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:24,240
and that could shed light into those fogs that my crystal ball cannot unveil.

22
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:32,240
Their work shows that decarbonising  the cement industry requires significant amounts of carbon capture and storage infrastructure

23
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,240
and should include measures beyond a change of production technologies.

24
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:43,240
More you can find at the Industrial Ecology conference in Leiden.

25
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,240
Yes!!! Thanks!!!

26
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:49,240
There was just what I was looking for. Fantastic.

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Byeeeeee

28
00:02:53,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Hmm, maybe I should look more into scientific future scenarios as well.

29
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,240
Let's change the cars. Let's think for a while.

30
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:48,240
Supply can wait, the raw materials from mines? Hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.

31
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,240
Are they gonna be ready or not?

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:59,305
From find to mine can't take forever. No one could tell who won't go never.

33
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:06,342
Individual, mines which, decisions can't switch, we'll need to have a plan.

34
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:09,194
Can you imagine when this race is won?

35
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,200
Mines will be ready to supply million tons.

36
00:04:12,215 --> 00:04:18,940
Simulating our mines we're getting in tune. We'll need to have a plan.

37
00:04:19,114 --> 00:04:26,114
Forever lithium.... we will need to have more mines

38
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:33,228
Do you really think they last forever? Forever? Or never?

39
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:39,867
Forever lithium.... we will need to have more mines

40
00:04:39,954 --> 00:04:44,629
Do you really think they last forever? Forever?

41
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:55,715
Some are like water, some are like rocks, some will be ready, and some will be not.

42
00:04:55,754 --> 00:05:00,436
So much uncertainty how this can be done.

43
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,380
What makes them go wrong?

44
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:07,486
Geology, costs and price also counts

45
00:05:07,586 --> 00:05:10,655
From east or west, or north from the south

46
00:05:10,798 --> 00:05:14,664
Monte Carlo does a 1000 runs

47
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:16,596
And we forcast however

48
00:05:17,295 --> 00:05:20,162
So many opportunities couldn't happen today

49
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,938
Circular economy still needs to play

50
00:05:24,142 --> 00:05:30,142
So many things are swinging out the blue. We let them come true.

51
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:37,368
Forever lithium, we will need to have more mines.

52
00:05:37,629 --> 00:05:44,762
Do you really think they last forever? Forever? Or never?

53
00:05:44,671 --> 00:05:50,196
Forever lithium, we will need to have more mines.

54
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:57,371
Do you really think they last forever? Or never? Forever?

55
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:03,429
Forever lithium, we will need to have more mines.

56
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:24,690
If we want to supply happily, forever....

57
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,694
North Rhine Westfalia is an important industrial hub for the steel sector in Germany.

58
00:06:58,145 --> 00:07:03,462
40% of the German steel production is yielded here in the Ruhrgebiet.

59
00:07:03,942 --> 00:07:08,643
The existing blast furnace production process is a very

60
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,198
carbon-intensive as it depends on coal to reduce the iron ore.

61
00:07:14,112 --> 00:07:18,659
Therefore, the industry is undergoing a transformation

62
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,112
process to shift to hydrogen-based steel.

63
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:26,485
Nonetheless, extensive amounts of renewable energies

64
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:30,283
are needed to secure the green hydrogen demand.

65
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:36,337
Also, such a transformation is associated with significant alterations

66
00:07:36,338 --> 00:07:41,368
in terms of processes and infrastructure and raw materials.

67
00:07:41,624 --> 00:07:49,138
Hence, the study aims at presenting an approach to analyse and quantify these changes.

68
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:59,522
Construction is a material-intensive industry.

69
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:02,539
Using recycled aggregates in the state of natural

70
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:05,539
ones is a promising circular economy application.

71
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,094
In this regard, various aspects and parameters

72
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,318
have to be considered. First, the type

73
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:18,135
of materials. Second, location as it affects the transportation and total costs.

74
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:22,183
The third dimension is time. For example, the

75
00:08:22,184 --> 00:08:26,031
German Federal State of North Rhine Westphalia,

76
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:33,648
which is the region of interest in our analysis, was extremely destroyed in the Second World War.

77
00:08:33,733 --> 00:08:37,875
Therefore, the housing stock in each district is different.

78
00:08:37,364 --> 00:08:41,678
For example, the housing stocks in some

79
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:46,078
regions have high ratios of classic houses,

80
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:51,245
while other have higher proportions of modern buildings.

81
00:08:51,074 --> 00:08:54,164
The different housing stocks imply dissimilar

82
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:58,087
construction and demolition activities in terms of time.

83
00:08:58,344 --> 00:09:03,190
The different building generations also imply dissimilar

84
00:09:03,191 --> 00:09:07,344
compositions and consequently material outflows.

85
00:09:07,173 --> 00:09:13,173
The demographic change also has a significant impact on the housing demand.

86
00:09:13,515 --> 00:09:17,636
For example, while the urban centers attract more

87
00:09:17,637 --> 00:09:22,515
inhabitants, the population of other regions is declining.

88
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:28,198
Therefore, the dynamic locational material flow analysis has

89
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:34,344
been derived to integrate all of these parameters in one model.

90
00:09:36,044 --> 00:09:40,396
The world needs increasingly more electricity, but all energy production

91
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:45,532
impacts our climate and biodiversity during construction and operation.

92
00:09:45,624 --> 00:09:48,563
Balancing energy needs and environmental impacts

93
00:09:48,564 --> 00:09:51,624
is the aim of this game that we developed at NTSU.

94
00:09:51,709 --> 00:09:55,171
On an island, with mountains, forests, meadows

95
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:58,709
and rivers, a city needs efficient electricity.

96
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:01,911
Biodeiversity is found in all regions but

97
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:05,051
have species with different levels of threat.

98
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:08,686
With carbon points, you can buy power infrastructures such as

99
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:13,368
hydro, wind, solar and fossil power plants and power lines.

100
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:17,014
All have a different carbon impact during construction and

101
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:20,453
operation and produce a different amount of electricity.

102
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,051
Your job is now to build and place the required power

103
00:10:24,052 --> 00:10:27,880
infrastructure for the city with the least biodiversity impacts.

104
00:10:27,885 --> 00:10:30,552
But you only have 5 rounds and a limited

105
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,800
carbon budget to achieve this goal.

106
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,246
Good luck in solving the energy and environmental crisis.
