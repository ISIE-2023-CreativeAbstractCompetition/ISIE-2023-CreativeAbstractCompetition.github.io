00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:19,280
Have you ever dreamt about the future of sustainable cement production?

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:35,600
It occupies your mind, whatever you do, 

3
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,680
not giving you a rest, even if you just want to relax.

4
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,200
So I did what everybody would have done in my place.

5
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Call inta my favourite fortune teller.

6
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Hello, I'm sorry, but do you know how we can reach 

7
00:00:54,200 --> 00:01:02,200
Paris Agreement compatible cement production?

8
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Don't worry dear, you talk to a true fortune teller.

9
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,200
Nothing can hide from my third eye.

10
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,200
It's cement, we're talking about.

11
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
Yes, thank you.

12
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Cement is currently responsible for 8% of the global greenhouse gas emissions.

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,200
So it's really important to better understand how to decarbonize it.

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,200
What a concrete problem.

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,200
I'm connecting with the universe right now.

16
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:47,200
But wait, there's an obscure fog clouding my vision 

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,200
It seems that cement is not only hard to abate, but also has predict.

18
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,200
Hmm, before she never failed me.

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,200
You know, if you try attending the ISIE conference, there's a poster by Amelie MÃ¼ller

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,200
and colleagues on prospective lifecycle assessment of the global cement production.

21
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,200
They coupled the output of ultra-calibre assessment models with prospective LCA,

22
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:22,200
and that could shed light into those fogs that my crystal ball cannot amaze.

23
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,200
Their work shows that decarbonizing cement industry requires significant amounts of carbon

24
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:36,200
capture and storage infrastructure and should include measures beyond a change of production technologies.

25
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,200
More you can find at the Industrial Ecology conference in Leiden.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Yes, thanks.

27
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,200
There was just what I was looking for.

28
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,200
Fantastic.

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:03:01,200
I should look more into the scientific future scenarios as well.

30
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,200
Thank you.
