Abstract:

The study aimed to investigate the effects of a novel intervention on cognitive function in older adults. A total of 100 participants aged 65 years and older were recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received a 12-week cognitive training program that focused on improving attention, memory, and executive function, while the control group received no intervention. Cognitive function was assessed using a battery of neuropsychological tests at baseline, post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up.

Results showed that the intervention group had significant improvements in attention, memory, and executive function compared to the control group at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. The effect sizes were moderate to large, indicating clinically meaningful improvements in cognitive function. The intervention group also showed greater improvements in everyday cognitive functioning and quality of life compared to the control group.

These findings suggest that the novel intervention is effective in improving cognitive function in older adults and has potential for use in clinical and community settings. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of the intervention and to identify the underlying mechanisms of the observed improvements in cognitive function.
