    <h4 style="color:white"><strong>Description:</strong> This visual abstract is a landscape painting, depicting metal mine areas as seen in false-colour satellite imagery. It was the result of a year-long collaboration with fine artist Ches Mills. I wrote code to produce imagery for selected metal mines that would be used as inspiration. I then consulted with Ches on the arrangement and representation of mines and their impacts on surrounding areas in this painting. The piece she produced depicts open cut pits, mine wastes, surrounding rivers and vegetation, as well as roads and human settlements. These are all aspects that can be detected and delineated using image processing algorithms to assess mine footprints. 

The painting invites viewers to consider the range of impacts that mines can have on surrounding landscapes, and the tensions between the need for mining to underpin global supply chains, versus the localised impacts that can be seen from above. </h4>

    <p style="color:white">Towards automated mapping of global mining land use

Advances in the quality and accessibility of satellite imagery have prompted rapid growth in research mapping the land footprint of mining. Multiple research teams have recently compiled open datasets with more than 150,000 polygons covering mining activities worldwide. These data help to explain the size, spread and nature of land use challenges linked to global material supply chains. Yet so far, it has only been viable to gather such data through a time-consuming manual process that requires trained analysts to visually recognise and delineate mine areas. Consequently, published updates on global mining land use are limited to approximately every two years. Meanwhile, mines are highly dynamic, constantly changing and expanding into new land. To keep pace with the real-time changes in mine areas globally, efforts to automate the task are needed.


This presentation outlines recent advances in the use of machine learning algorithms to automatically detect mine areas in satellite imagery. Building from this, we will discuss barriers and progress towards automating the global mapping of mine areas. Through a series of mapping case studies, we will also illustrate what levels of geometric and categorical accuracy can be achieved for different types of mine features, and for different parts of the world. Finally, we will discuss the implications of access to timely global mine land use data on broader field of industrial ecology, on governments, and the mining industry itself.</p>
