        <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> The field of industrial ecology aims to understand the interactions between human systems and the natural environment, and to promote sustainable practices that minimize negative impacts. However, despite progress in implementing eco-friendly technologies and policies, industrial ecology still faces significant challenges in achieving its goals. One of the most persistent of these challenges is the profound sadness that accompanies the recognition of the scale and severity of environmental degradation caused by human activity. This paper explores the emotional burden faced by practitioners of industrial ecology, and argues that acknowledging and addressing this sadness is crucial to maintaining resilience and motivation in the face of ongoing environmental crises. Drawing on personal narratives and empirical research, we offer insights into the psychological and emotional dimensions of industrial ecology, and propose strategies for fostering emotional wellbeing and engagement among practitioners. By acknowledging the eternal sadness of industrial ecology, we can better equip ourselves to face the immense challenges of building a sustainable future.</li>
