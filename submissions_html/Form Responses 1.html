However, despite progress in implementing eco-friendly technologies and policies, industrial ecology still faces significant challenges in achieving its goals. One of the most persistent of these challenges is the profound sadness that accompanies the recognition of the scale and severity of environmental degradation caused by human activity. This paper explores the emotional burden faced by practitioners of industrial ecology, and argues that acknowledging and addressing this sadness is crucial to maintaining resilience and motivation in the face of ongoing environmental crises. Drawing on personal narratives and empirical research, we offer insights into the psychological and emotional dimensions of industrial ecology, and propose strategies for fostering emotional wellbeing and engagement among practitioners. By acknowledging the eternal sadness of industrial ecology, we can better equip ourselves to face the immense challenges of building a sustainable future.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E77cz1m_blVQ2DSvW46RhLkSJKoi3nJf">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E77cz1m_blVQ2DSvW46RhLkSJKoi3nJf</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R2" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">3</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">5/29/2023 0:08:28</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">tonethmisewwandi@gmail.com</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Kankanamge Dona Nethmi Sewwandi</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">tonethmisewwandi@gmail.com</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">University of Ulsan</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1138</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Sustainable Harmonies</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Text</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">A poem</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Abstract<br><br>Eco-industrial parks (EIPs) strive to promote sustainable industrial development by integrating environmental, economic, and social objectives. Despite the limited success of many national EIP programs, China, Japan and Korea have reported significant achievements in this field. This paper aims to characterize the three countries’ national EIP projects to draw specific focus and implementation strategies. This study consists of two interrelated parts: 1) bibliometric analysis; and 2) the characterization of EIP development through a literature content analysis. The combination of ScienceDirect (Scopus), Web of Science (WoS), and Dimensions publication databases from 1998 until 2022 were used in this study. The bibliometric analysis was done by refining only the most-related literature based on the typical keywords and content, then visualized by using the VosViewer software for the keyword co-occurrence analysis. It was performed to analyze the EIPs research trend from 1998 to 2022. Based on the keyword co-occurrence analysis, the most popular keywords for EIP research in China are “industrial symbiosis” and “network”. Meanwhile, “waste” is the most popular keyword in Japan Eco-town’s publication; and “eco-industrial park” and “industrial symbiosis” are the most popular keywords for Korean EIP scientific publications. Based on further analysis, the focus of EIPs in China is resource efficiency and industrial upgrading through industrial symbiosis and networking. Korean model EIPs have a strong focus on innovation and technology in EIP transition, with a particular emphasis on industrial symbiosis development by business model based on triple bottom-line benefits. EIPs in Japan, or Eco-town projects, are characterized by a focus on waste recycling and the reuse of resources, as well as the development of sustainable infrastructure. Overall, the characterization of EIPs in China, Korea, and Japan is similar in selection and approval of EIP and business approaches, but they may differ in terms of their specific focus, priorities, and funding mechanisms.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:448px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IY-yjqVx1gfByIXtjTMsezVIwlX-nlI0">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IY-yjqVx1gfByIXtjTMsezVIwlX-nlI0</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R3" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">4</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/15/2023 17:47:18</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">laurabuarque89@gmail.com</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Laura Buarque Andrade</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">l.buarque@hzdr.de</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">HZDR</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1191</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Quantitative assessment of global future Lithium supply: Simulating mining projects and predicting production start times</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Audio</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Adapted from the original song &quot;Forever young&quot;, this parody combines the principal author&#39;s main passions: karaoke and future supply.

Existing assessments need to be improved by a lack of consideration for the decision-making processes occurring at the level of individual mining projects. In the present contribution, we demonstrate how these processes and associated uncertainties can be incorporated into an assessment of the likely future evolution of the global Li market. Our method uses Monte Carlo simulations to achieve this goal. A global database of existing Li mining projects (all development stages, including case histories) is used to build models to estimate the likelihood of each project proceeding to the next development stage in any given year, depending on specific project characteristics such as location, deposit type, and ore grade, as well as market conditions, i.e., Li price and demand. Iterative stochastic simulations are then run, in which projects are moved through the development pipeline according to these estimated likelihoods, year-by-year, up to 2050. Discoveries are also included in the model to achieve realistic results over the relatively long period covered. Simple, functional models estimate future Li demand, including uncertainty. The simulations generate a large set of equally probable scenarios (1,000 or more) of which projects enter production when, whether primary supply can meet demand in any given year, and what the likely mean Li price is for that year. Summarising the data from all scenarios provides an impression of the likely evolution of the Li market up to 2050. Besides this likely market evolution, the simulation outputs can be used further to assess the probable environmental impacts of future primary Li supply</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FGgKMEvVlaK8paLUmRKhirF5FwpJI9kv">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FGgKMEvVlaK8paLUmRKhirF5FwpJI9kv</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R4" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">5</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/20/2023 15:28:36</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">werner.tim@gmail.com</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Dr. Tim Werner</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">tim.werner@unimelb.edu.au</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">University of Melbourne</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">439</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Dilemma&#39;: A landscape painting of mine areas in satellite imagery</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Visual</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">This visual abstract is a landscape painting, depicting metal mine areas as seen in false-colour satellite imagery.

Multiple research teams have recently compiled open datasets with more than 150,000 polygons covering mining activities worldwide. These data help to explain the size, spread and nature of land use challenges linked to global material supply chains. Yet so far, it has only been viable to gather such data through a time-consuming manual process that requires trained analysts to visually recognise and delineate mine areas. Consequently, published updates on global mining land use are limited to approximately every two years. Meanwhile, mines are highly dynamic, constantly changing and expanding into new land. To keep pace with the real-time changes in mine areas globally, efforts to automate the task are needed.<br><br><br>This presentation outlines recent advances in the use of machine learning algorithms to automatically detect mine areas in satellite imagery. Building from this, we will discuss barriers and progress towards automating the global mapping of mine areas. Through a series of mapping case studies, we will also illustrate what levels of geometric and categorical accuracy can be achieved for different types of mine features, and for different parts of the world. Finally, we will discuss the implications of access to timely global mine land use data on broader field of industrial ecology, on governments, and the mining industry itself.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bRgDpglaZxIOcRcKzjhqL07cB73ZDN7J">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bRgDpglaZxIOcRcKzjhqL07cB73ZDN7J</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R5" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">6</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/24/2023 10:29:49</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ali Abdelshafy</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Chair of Operations Management - RWTH Aachen University</div></td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1518</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Using integrated MFA approaches to model industrial transformation: Case studies from the construction sector in Germany</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Video</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The video illustrates one of the models presented in the study (i.e. Dynamic-Locational material flow Analysis).

Due to the increasing number of research questions and fields of industrial transformation, more methodological integrations and extensions are still required. Herein, this study presents three integrated MFA models, which have been derived and applied on three case studies. First, an intersectoral MFA model is developed to investigate the impacts and interdependencies of the transition of the energy system and the implementation of a circular economy. For example, the shift towards green steel will have an impact on the availability of blast furnace slag, which is used to produce CEM II and III. Also, the coal phase-out act in Germany will affect the amounts of fly ash and FGD gypsum. Herein, the model’s framework consists of three consecutive steps. First, the production processes are studied and the relevant inflows, outflows and stocks are determined. Second, the identified inflows and outflows are quantified. Finally, the alterations caused by the industrial transformation are analyzed. The presented model and analyses can help the policymakers and strategists to understand the intra- and intersectoral relations, impacts of relevant policies, and the associated changes in the material and emission flows.<br><br>As the location has a crucial impact on the construction activities and relevant transportation costs, integrating the spatial dimension can be essential for certain analyses. Hence, the second model (spatial MFA) has been developed to consider both the locations and quantities of the relevant materials. Herein, the presented case study investigates the potentials of coupling a carbon capture and utilization technology (i.e. carbonation) with the supply chain of construction sector. Similar to the first model, the framework is composed on three phases. First an MFA model of the regional construction sector has been used to identify and quantify the construction products suitable for carbonation. Thereafter, detailed atlases of the relevant construction products and waste streams have been derived to determine the locations and quantities of the relevant flows. Finally, location-allocation models have been developed to optimize the routes between the CO2 sources and relevant flows. Therefore, besides the quantifying the CO2 sequestration capacities, the analyses also quantify the impact of transportation on the prospective carbonation supply chains.<br><br>Besides location, the time dimension is essential for some material flows and supply chains. Linking recycling operations with construction activities is mandatory for promoting circular economy in the construction sector. Hence, similar to the preceding model, integrating the spatial aspect is important for minimizing the transportation costs. Additionally, the temporal dimension is also important due to the changes in the patterns of supply and demand over time. Herein, the dynamic-locational MFA model has been derived to integrate both dimensions into one framework. The first step in the framework is identifying the relevant parameters and collecting the databases in order to conduct the empirical analysis. The survival and construction functions are then derived to forecast the future demolition and construction activities. Finally, the associated material flows are estimated in each locational and temporal unit. Accordingly, the supply and demand of secondary resources can be matched and the relevant strategies can be developed.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kl7Gh1AmqwMcYs_6tb3ypV3teIu6Q_Gr">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kl7Gh1AmqwMcYs_6tb3ypV3teIu6Q_Gr</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R6" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">7</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/24/2023 10:40:41</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ali Abdelshafy</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Chair of Operations Management - RWTH Aachen University</div></td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1217</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Modelling the regional transformation to hydrogen-based green steel: An integrative and prospective material flow analysis of the North Rhine-Westphalian steel industry</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Video</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The video depicts the transformation of the steel industry in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Due to the high carbon footprint of the blast furnace process, hydrogen-based direct reduction has emerged as a promising low-carbon technology. Nonetheless, such alteration is associated with significant changes in terms of processes, infrastructure and raw materials as well as a huge demand of renewable energies. Hence, the study aims at presenting an approach to quantify these changes and demonstrating it on a real case study.</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The production of primary steel is characterized by a high emission intensity. Due to its high coal consumption, the steel industry is responsible for around 30 % of industrial greenhouse gas emissions and thus for 5 % of total German emissions. In North Rhine-Westphalia, steel production accounts for up to 30 million tonnes or even more than 10 % of the state&#39;s total emissions. The enormous coal consumption is not only due to the high energy demand, but also to the process-related coal dependency of the classic blast furnace process.<br><br>For a far-reaching decarbonisation of the North Rhine-Westphalian industry, the introduction and rapid diffusion of new technologies and processes in steel production is essential. Two approaches are feasible: one is to maintain existing processes with retrofitted Carbon Capture and Usage or Storage, and the other is to avoid emissions through process changes (i.e. Carbon Direct Avoidance). Herein, direct reduction has emerged as a promising Carbon Direct Avoidance technique in the steel industry. All major German steel producers have announced specific steps to substitute coal-based feedstocks by switching to hydrogen-based direct reduction processes. If the hydrogen production and utilization of the steel producers are supplied by renewable energy sources, emissions can be largely avoided. However, this path is associated with far-reaching technical and procedural changes as well as a substantially increased demand for renewable electricity.<br><br>Hence, this study presents a case study from Western Germany via quantifying the changes in the regional material and energy flows in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia until the planned decarbonisation in 2045. The quantitative analysis firstly presents a detailed material and energy flow model that depicts the existing supply chain of the regional industry and intersectoral relations. Thereafter, a detailed process simulation model of hydrogen-based steel production is developed according to the industry&#39;s detailed technological plans to track the regional impacts of such a transformation to achieve zero-emission steel. In combination with different assumptions on the availability of green hydrogen and complementary climate reduction measures, the results of the process simulation are integrated into the material and energy flow model to map possible stepwise transformation paths until 2045. Here, the analyses show that with a maximum focus on hydrogen, more than 47 TWh of electricity from renewable energies could be required per year for these structural changes. Consequently, our work quantifies different approaches by which the decarbonization of the steel industry can be achieved with lower amounts of renewable electricity. For example, partial reliance on natural gas as a reducing agent in combination with the use of CCUS technologies can significantly reduce electricity demand for the transformation, especially in the medium term.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SjWcfWXpldmDgZyAjNQOHPMYznZxk3Te">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1SjWcfWXpldmDgZyAjNQOHPMYznZxk3Te</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R7" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">8</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/25/2023 15:38:30</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ali Abdelshafy</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Chair of Operations Management</div></td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1518</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Using integrated MFA approaches to model industrial transformation: Case studies from the construction sector in Germany</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Video</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The video illustrates one of the models presented in the study (i.e. Dynamic-Locational material flow Analysis).

Herein, the dynamic-locational MFA model has been derived to integrate both dimensions into one framework. The first step in the framework is identifying the relevant parameters and collecting the databases in order to conduct the empirical analysis. The survival and construction functions are then derived to forecast the future demolition and construction activities. Finally, the associated material flows are estimated in each locational and temporal unit. Accordingly, the supply and demand of secondary resources can be matched and the relevant strategies can be developed.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GOpLcTbWZQYxbs4HVjTGBLXSFKiF2BBy">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GOpLcTbWZQYxbs4HVjTGBLXSFKiF2BBy</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R8" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">9</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/25/2023 15:44:08</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Ali Abdelshafy</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">ali.abdelshafy@om.rwth-aachen.de</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Chair of Operation Management</div></td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">1217</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Modelling the regional transformation to hydrogen-based green steel: An integrative and prospective material flow analysis of the North Rhine-Westphalian steel industry</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Video</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The video depicts the transformation of the steel industry in the German federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Due to the high carbon footprint of the blast furnace process, hydrogen-based direct reduction has emerged as a promising low-carbon technology. Nonetheless, such alteration is associated with significant changes in terms of processes, infrastructure and raw materials as well as a huge demand of renewable energies. Hence, the study aims at presenting an approach to quantify these changes and demonstrating it on a real case study.</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The production of primary steel is characterized by a high emission intensity. Due to its high coal consumption, the steel industry is responsible for around 30 % of industrial greenhouse gas emissions and thus for 5 % of total German emissions. In North Rhine-Westphalia, steel production accounts for up to 30 million tonnes or even more than 10 % of the state&#39;s total emissions. The enormous coal consumption is not only due to the high energy demand, but also to the process-related coal dependency of the classic blast furnace process.<br><br>For a far-reaching decarbonisation of the North Rhine-Westphalian industry, the introduction and rapid diffusion of new technologies and processes in steel production is essential. Two approaches are feasible: one is to maintain existing processes with retrofitted Carbon Capture and Usage or Storage, and the other is to avoid emissions through process changes (i.e. Carbon Direct Avoidance). Herein, direct reduction has emerged as a promising Carbon Direct Avoidance technique in the steel industry. All major German steel producers have announced specific steps to substitute coal-based feedstocks by switching to hydrogen-based direct reduction processes. If the hydrogen production and utilization of the steel producers are supplied by renewable energy sources, emissions can be largely avoided. However, this path is associated with far-reaching technical and procedural changes as well as a substantially increased demand for renewable electricity.<br><br>Hence, this study presents a case study from Western Germany via quantifying the changes in the regional material and energy flows in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia until the planned decarbonisation in 2045. The quantitative analysis firstly presents a detailed material and energy flow model that depicts the existing supply chain of the regional industry and intersectoral relations. Thereafter, a detailed process simulation model of hydrogen-based steel production is developed according to the industry&#39;s detailed technological plans to track the regional impacts of such a transformation to achieve zero-emission steel. In combination with different assumptions on the availability of green hydrogen and complementary climate reduction measures, the results of the process simulation are integrated into the material and energy flow model to map possible stepwise transformation paths until 2045. Here, the analyses show that with a maximum focus on hydrogen, more than 47 TWh of electricity from renewable energies could be required per year for these structural changes. Consequently, our work quantifies different approaches by which the decarbonization of the steel industry can be achieved with lower amounts of renewable electricity. For example, partial reliance on natural gas as a reducing agent in combination with the use of CCUS technologies can significantly reduce electricity demand for the transformation, especially in the medium term.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:448px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P0MFavh64UBlX2ukjvGW1t-Bezvedrch">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1P0MFavh64UBlX2ukjvGW1t-Bezvedrch</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R9" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">10</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/25/2023 20:20:17</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">shekhar4@purdue.edu</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Abhimanyu Raj Shekhar</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">shekhar4@purdue.edu</td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Purdue University</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">752</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Reverse logistics of critical elements derived from electric vehicle lithium-ion batteries</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Text</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">Avengers Assemble: The Epic Saga of Lithium-Ion Battery Recycling from Electric Vehicles</div></td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The recent advancements toward national electrification of the US have led to rapid manufacturing of massive quantities of electric vehicles (EVs) that utilize high amounts of lithium-ion batteries (LiBs). Such development poses the risk of rapid exhaustion of primary critical metals and excessive waste battery generation. Critical metals like cobalt, nickel, and manganese serve to be excellent precursors in the battery manufacturing industry as they can be recycled indefinitely without losing their physical or chemical characteristics. The circularity of these critical metals in an economy can be advanced by analyzing potential reverse logistics scenarios based on the spatial construction of cost-optimized battery recycling facilities. Here, we demonstrate the development of a regional structure of battery recycling facilities and spent battery collection centers in the US under deep future uncertainties correlated with the variation in market share of LiB chemistry composition and the changes in recycling technology. Using RELOG: Reverse Logistics Optimization, a simulation of battery collection and recovery was created over a 40-year timeline, with a LiB chemistry composition of 62% NCA and 38% NMC reflecting the current market share of cathode chemistries in the EV sector. Simulating three specific recycling technology cases, viz. pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, and direct, the preliminary result provided the spatial distribution of collection centers, disassembly plants, and battery recycling facilities, along with the cost and emission data for each case. Principally, the development of direct recycling facilities across the nation came out to be the most cost-optimal solution when including recovered material resale value. A comparative assessment is anticipated to be carried out for this baseline scenario with two extreme future scenarios, one where the market share comprises 12% NCA, 38% NMC, and 50% LFP; and the other being 12% NCA and 88% LFP, which complies with the current trend towards reliance on LFP-based batteries.</div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:448px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U3JtgM7O3-zo6Soy-XpOIlEbcfk7RWhh">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U3JtgM7O3-zo6Soy-XpOIlEbcfk7RWhh</a></div></td></tr><tr style="height: 20px"><th id="1999896102R10" style="height: 20px;" class="row-headers-background"><div class="row-header-wrapper" style="line-height: 20px">11</div></th><td class="s1" dir="ltr">6/26/2023 20:43:50</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">c.bocher@cml.leidenuniv.nl</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Catrin Böcher</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">c.bocher@cml.leidenuniv.nl</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">CML - Universiteit Leiden</td><td class="s1" dir="ltr">735</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">A material flow analysis of sand use in the Netherlands</div></td><td class="s0" dir="ltr">Physical</td><td class="s0 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:147px;left:-1px">The glasses comparatively show the amounts of sand used and flowing out in 2019.

Furthermore, sand mining can have serious environmental consequences. Considering the globally increasing rate of construction, land reclamation and coastal protection projects, together with other industrial uses of sand, global demand for sand will only increase in coming decades. Research on sand from a sustainability perspective has only started to emerge in recent years. In this research, we look at the stocks and flows of sand in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is an interesting case study, as it is a country that will be at high risk by rising sea levels resulting in a great need for coastal protection. This risk exposure is likely to considerably increase the demand for sand in the Netherlands. Furthermore, the Netherlands, together with Belgium, is an important player in the global sand dredging industry. Using material flow analysis (MFA), we quantify the current stocks and flows of sand in the Netherlands. This will help to get a better understanding of the types and quantities of sand used and understand some dynamics around it. This research will help to identify inefficiencies and losses in how we use sand. These insights will contribute to a better understanding of how we can manage our sand resources in more sustainable ways. </div></td><td class="s2 softmerge" dir="ltr"><div class="softmerge-inner" style="width:598px;left:-1px"><a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tzz_-M4kaOKgTtY7kQu3xCMLOrrMbslQ">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Tzz_-M4kaOKgTtY7kQu3xCMLOrrMbslQ</a></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
